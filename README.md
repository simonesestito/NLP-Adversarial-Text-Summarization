# Redoing Seq2Sick
The original implementation is broken with modern Python environment because of ancient dependencies.

The implementation from [FSE22_NMTSloth](https://github.com/SeekingDream/FSE22_NMTSloth/blob/64c50a6edc38262a69a89edb596b25b6d85f500e/src/baseline_attack.py#L94) is very good, but we needed to make a small copy for a different experiment, and not something related to their paper.
