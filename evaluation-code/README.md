# Evaluation metrics

This can be considered a subproject of the original one.

This contains the code that is used in the section **6. Comparative Evaluation** of our paper.

It aims to compare multiple text summarization models and see how good are they with other scores and datasets.
This is the code to effectively use SummEval for our goal.

This is *NOT* part of Adversarial Attacks, but still in the same survey / project.
